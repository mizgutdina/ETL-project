### Two data sources:
1)	Starbucks locations dataset from **Kaggle** https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/store-locations
2)	IRS income by Zip Code (CY2013) from **data.world** https://data.world/jonloyens/irs-income-by-zip-code

### Final Output:

Tables joined by zip code. Data cleaning will be a large part of the project, since the zip codes in Starbucks database are formatted differently.

### Potential project:

*Hypothesis:* Starbucks tends to be located in higher income zip codes.
